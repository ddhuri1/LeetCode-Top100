1. Two Sum:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

2. Add Two Numbers:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays:

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0

Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

5. Longest Palindromic Substring:

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

7. Reverse Integer:

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321

8. String to Integer (atoi):

Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

Example 1:
Input: "42"
Output: 42

Example 2:
Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
             
10. Regular Expression Matching:

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:
s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

Example 1:
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

11. Container With Most Water:

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Example:
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

13. Roman to Integer:

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
                Symbol       Value
                I             1
                V             5
                X             10
                L             50
                C             100
                D             500
                M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
Input: "III"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: "IV"
Output: 4

14. Longest Common Prefix:

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Note:All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.

15. 3Sum:

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number:

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

Example:
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

19. Remove Nth Node From End of List:

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

20. Valid Parentheses:

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:
Input: "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists:

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

22. Generate Parentheses:

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]

23. Merge k Sorted Lists:

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:
Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

28. Implement strStr():

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1

163. Missing Ranges

Given a sorted integer array nums, where the range of elements are in the inclusive range [lower, upper], return its missing ranges.

Example:
Input: nums = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75], lower = 0 and upper = 99,
Output: ["2", "4->49", "51->74", "76->99"]

348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.
You may assume the following rules:
A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);
toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | 
toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |
toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|
toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|
toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|
toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|
toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|

340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

308. Range Sum Query 2D - Mutable

Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) 
and lower right corner (row2, col2).
Range Sum Query 2D
The above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = (2, 1) and (row2, col2) = (4, 3), which contains sum = 8.

Example:
Given matrix = [
  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],
  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],
  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]
]
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8
update(3, 2, 2)
sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 10

285. Inorder Successor in BST

Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.
The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

277. Find the Celebrity

Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 
people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions
like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one)
by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B.
Implement a function int findCelebrity(n). There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label
if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: graph = [
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, 
otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.

269. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. 
You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. 
Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:
Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]
Output: "wertf"

253. Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei),
find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:
Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

251. Flatten 2D Vector

Design and implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector. It should support the following operations: next and hasNext.

Exaple:
Vector2D iterator = new Vector2D([[1,2],[3],[4]]);
iterator.next(); // return 1
iterator.next(); // return 2
iterator.next(); // return 3
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next(); // return 4
iterator.hasNext(); // return false

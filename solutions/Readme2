101. Symmetric Tree

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, 
this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
   
102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]

104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.

105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Example,
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Return the following binary tree:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
   
   
108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the
two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 
116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. 
The binary tree has the following definition:
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree, your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, 
just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, 
with '#' signifying the end of each level.

118. Pascal's Triangle

Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:
Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]

121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), 
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
             
122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like 
i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
             
124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child 
connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6

125. Valid Palindrome

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

127. Word Ladder

Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list,
find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Note:
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
All words have the same length.
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

130. Surrounded Regions

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
Explanation:
Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. 
Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. 
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

131. Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

Example:
Input: "aab"
Output:
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]

134. Gas Station

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). 
You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Note:
If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

Example 1:
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

138. Copy List with Random Pointer

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
Return a deep copy of the list.
The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] 
where:
val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
 

Example 1:
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

139. Word Break

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented 
into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:
The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

140. Word Break II

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, 
add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences.

Note:
The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]

141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list
where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

146. LRU Cache

Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, 
it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.
Follow up:
Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

Example:
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );
cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4

148. Sort List

Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.

Example 2:
Input: -1->5->3->4->0
Output: -1->0->3->4->5

149. Max Points on a Line

|
|        o
|     o
|  o  
+------------->
0  1  2  3  4

150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

Note:
Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.

Example 1:
Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Example 2:
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

155. Min Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.

Example 1:
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). 
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. 

162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.
The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
